* Guile-ICS
  iCalendar format ([[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545][RFC5545]]) parser for GNU Guile.

  The project is in an early development stage, so the API is not
  stabilized yet.

   Guile-ICS is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under

** Usage
   The module may be used as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
#!/usr/bin/guile \
-e main
!#

(use-modules (ice-9 pretty-print)
             (srfi srfi-41) ; Streams
             (ics))         ; Guile-ICS

(define (main args)
  (stream-for-each (lambda (ical-object)
                     (display "RESULT: \n")
                     (pretty-print ical-object))
                   (ics->stream)))
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Known bugs
   - Properties with parameters (separated by semicolon) are not
     handled properly (see [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.1.1][RFC5545, Section 3.1.1]].)
   - iCalendar value lists represented as Scheme strings, not as
     Scheme lists.
