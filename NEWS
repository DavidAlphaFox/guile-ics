* Changes in version 0.1.1 (2017-01-07)
** Bugfixes
*** Fixed library building scripts
    Autotools would fail to build the library and run tests due to an
    error in Automake files.  The patch fixes that.
*** Remove bogus dependency on 'guile-lib' package
    Some modules used 'define-with-docs' which is part of 'guile-lib'
    package.  The dependency was not documented and lead to errors
    when the 'guile-lib' was missing.

    The dependency was removed as it seems not worthy of requiring the
    whole library only just for 'define-with-docs' facilities.

* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2017-01-07)
