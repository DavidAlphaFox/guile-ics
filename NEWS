* Changes in version 0.2.0 (2017-12-25)
** The library is mostly re-written with GOOPS
   Now most of the API is object-oriented.
** Added support for iCalendar property value types
** New features
*** The library now supports lists of values (RFC 5545, 3.1.1.)
*** The library now handles escaped chars in TEXT values (RFC 5545, 3.3.11)
** Bugfixes
*** Remove bogus dependency on 'guile-lib'
    There was an extra dependency on (scheme documentation) module
    that I overlooked in the previous release, which is now removed.
** Added the project logo
** Documentation is updated
** Examples are updated
** Unit tests updated; new tests added

* Changes in version 0.1.1 (2017-01-07)
** Bugfixes
*** Fixed library building scripts
    Autotools would fail to build the library and run tests due to an
    error in Automake files.  The patch fixes that.
*** Remove bogus dependency on 'guile-lib' package
    Some modules used 'define-with-docs' which is part of 'guile-lib'
    package.  The dependency was not documented and lead to errors
    when the 'guile-lib' was missing.

    The dependency was removed as it seems not worthy of requiring the
    whole library only just for 'define-with-docs' facilities.

* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2017-01-07)
** Release of the first stable version of Guile-ICS
