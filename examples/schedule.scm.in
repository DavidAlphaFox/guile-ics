;;; Commentary:

;; Read events in iCalendar format and print it to stdout in the
;; following format:
;;
;;   <event-name>: <start> - <end>
;;
;; Usage example:
;;
;;   $ ./schedule.scm https://example.org/basic.ics
;;

;;; Code:

(use-modules (ice-9 popen)
             (ice-9 getopt-long)
             (srfi srfi-41)             ; streams
             ;; Guile-ICS
             (ics)
             (ics ical-object)
             (ics ical-property))
